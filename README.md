# EasyADB
There are users who do not know how to use the Windows command line, or who do not like to use it. And sometimes you need to perform certain actions with your Android device. For example, you want to unlock the phone's bootloader in order to root it, and for this you need to use ADB (Android Debug Bridge) and, consequently, use the command line to use it. But what if you do not know how to do this? Can you look it up online? This way, there is a high chance of losing your device due to improper use of ADB. That's why I created a special program called EasyADB. It has a graphical interface and an intuitive concept of what to do. The program provides output to understand how ADB responded to the command. The program must be run as an administrator. Most importantly, the program is written entirely in Python! Good luck! Try not to brick your device! :)
